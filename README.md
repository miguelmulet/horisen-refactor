## Description
For this assignment I was instructed to renovate and improve the accessibility of Horiseon Marketing Agency's Landing Page. Updating to the UI, proper addition of HTML semantic elements were added, the code was restructed so it'd fall in the classic HTML "waterfall" style. Links to all the functions were updated and now working properly. Best of all the Horiseon's landing page is now running without any errors whatsoever.
